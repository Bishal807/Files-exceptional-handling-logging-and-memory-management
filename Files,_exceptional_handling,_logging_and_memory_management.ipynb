        "### **Conceptual Questions**\n",
        "#### **1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "- **Interpreted languages** execute code line-by-line using an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript), making debugging easier but slower.\n",
        "- **Compiled languages** convert the entire code into machine language before execution (e.g., C, C++), resulting in faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "- Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "- The `finally` block ensures that specific cleanup code (like closing files) runs whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "- Logging is a way to track events in a program using Python’s `logging` module, which helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "- The `__del__` method is called when an object is deleted, useful for cleanup actions like closing file handles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **6. What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**\n",
        "- `import module` imports the entire module.\n",
        "- `from module import function` imports only a specific function/class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "- Using multiple `except` blocks or a single `except` with a tuple of exceptions:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  try:\n",
        "      x = 10 / 0\n",
        "  except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n",
        "      print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **8. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "- It ensures automatic file closure after operations, avoiding resource leaks.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
        "      content = f.read()\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads within the same process share memory.\n",
        "- **Multiprocessing**: Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "- Debugging, error tracking, and performance monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "- Python manages memory using reference counting, garbage collection, and heap memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "1. Wrap code in `try`\n",
        "2. Handle errors using `except`\n",
        "3. Use `finally` if cleanup is needed\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "- Prevents memory leaks and optimizes performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "- `try` block contains code that may raise an exception, while `except` handles the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "- It automatically deallocates memory using reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "- It runs if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "- `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **18. What is the difference between `os.fork()` and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "- `os.fork()` creates a child process (Linux only).\n",
        "- `multiprocessing` module works cross-platform and provides better control.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "- Prevents memory leaks and ensures data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **20. What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "- `read()` reads the whole file, while `readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "- Recording program execution details.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **22. What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "- Interacting with the operating system, like file handling (`os.path`, `os.remove`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "- High memory usage, cyclic references, and garbage collection overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  raise ValueError(\"This is a custom error.\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "- It improves performance in I/O-bound tasks.\n",
